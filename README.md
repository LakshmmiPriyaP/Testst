The ‘World No Tobacco Day’ just whizzed past us on May 31st.

Smoking tobacco, has been widely prevalent across time and civilizations. The tobacco plant, Nicotiana tabacum, is named after a 16th century French diplomat Jean Nicot, who made it famous in Europe. It was initially used as a health cure for every imaginable disease, from headaches to cancer.

The gradual but widespread increase in global smoking rates, promoted by targeted advertising from the manufacturers, led the WHO in 2008, to declare tobacco as the most common cause of preventable diseases in the world.

At least 70 of the more than 7000 chemicals in tobacco smoke, cause cancer. The cigarettes also release radioactive substances when smoking, which are then drawn into the lung. Nicotine, the chief addictive chemical, makes the smoking habit very difficult to quit.
